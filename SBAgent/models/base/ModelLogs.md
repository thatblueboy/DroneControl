# Model Registry

## [`model1`](./model1/)

Trained with with the improved reward function, `DISTANCE_PENALTY=4`, `MINOR_SAFETY_PENALTY=1` and `MAJOR_SAFETY_PENALTY=5`. No noise during training.

## [`model2`](./model2/)

Same reward function. Trained with unbiased noise with standard deviation 0.1

## [`model3`](./model3/)

Same reward function. Trained with unbiased noise with standard deviation 1.0

## [`model4`](./model4/)
Same reward function. Trained with no noise in dynamic environment with 2 obstacles.
